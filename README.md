# California_Wildfire_Damage

Name: Ravi Kumar Bandaru

Status: Completed

Project Description:

Wildfires in California cause massive destruction, leading to loss of homes, businesses, and billions in financial damage. Understanding what factors contribute to the worst firesâ€”such as causes, fire size, and seasonal patterns can help insurance companies, policymakers, and emergency services make better decisions to reduce risk and financial losses.

--> Analyzed historical wildfire data to uncover patterns in causes, frequency, and damage.

--> Built a machine learning model to predict financial loss based on fire characteristics.

--> Although prediction accuracy was limited, the model revealed key cost drivers: area burned, homes destroyed, human-caused ignition, fatalities, and vehicle damage.

--> Insights support more effective fire prevention, residential risk planning, and resource allocation.
